<h2>Introduction 👋</h2>

Starter guide for setting up a crypto digital wallet and navigating the NFT space.

<h3>What's an NFT?? </h3>

[NFTs](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fopensea.io%2Fblog%2Fguides%2Fnon-fungible-tokens) are non-fungible tokens. You might be wondering what the heck are non-fungible tokens and is that even a word? 

Understanding what NFTs are is the first step on your journey. <b>"Non-fungible"</b> means that an item is unique and cannot be replaced with something else. Since the name is so long, we use <b>NFT</b>. Got it?

NFTs in itself are a unique token (or in tech terms a long number or string) that is associated with some kind of media: Art, Gifs, JPGs, Video, Collectibles, Avatars, Music.

Companies such as Tik Tok, Twitter and Facebook are also moving into the space, with Facebook soon changing it's name to focus more on the metaverse (social media, gaming, VR, crypto).

<h3>Before You Continue</h3>

I'm not here to give you any investment advice, however with a little time and patience (and of course reading) you'll be well on your way to understanding what NFT's are all about. Think of it as buying a pair of expensive sneakers, but instead you're investing that $300 in crypto or an NFT.

<h2>Get Started 📎</h2>

<h3>Download Coinbase 💰</h3>

First thing you'll need is the [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) app. Straightforward process. Download either in the iOS or Android app stores.

<i>Note - Coinbase recently announced [Coinbase NFT](https://www.coinbase.com/NFT/announce) which may soon make it easier to buy and sell. The service hasn't launched yet. Stay tuned.</i>

<h3>Add Some Money 💸</h3>

Now that you are in Coinbase and set up, you'll need to add some cash to your account. You'll need a debit card or some type of account to fund it such as a checking, savings, or Paypal account. You'll use it to buy your crypto once it's added to the Coinbase account.

<h3>Do I Need a Lot of Money? </h3>

No. Start off small. Remember to look at this as an investment. Whether you're using Coinbase, Cashapp or Robinhood. They're all a type of investment app and with with any investment you are taking a risk. Start off with as much as you see fit. 

<h3>Purchase Ethereum or Ether ( Ξ is the symbol for ETH)</h3>

Ethereum is a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, called Ether (ETH) or Ethereum, and its own programming language, called Solidity.

<i>In case you were wondering: [Bitcoin vs Ethereum - Differences](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/031416/bitcoin-vs-ethereum-driven-different-purposes.asp)</i>

<h3>Understand ETH Ξ to USD Conversions 🏦</h3>

It's important to understand the value of Ethereum and what it translates to in USD. Markets change. The value of an ETH today may not be the same tomorrow. When making purchases that require ETH for example:

<p>1 Eth = $4,112.76</p>
<p>0.02 Eth = $82.26</p>
<p>0.07 Eth = $287.89</p>
  
Search Ethereum conversion via Google:

<h2>Wallets</h2>

<h3>Your Digital Wallet - Coinbase</h3>

You'll notice that in Coinbase there is a section to send crypto to another wallet. This where you will send Ethereum to 👇

<h3>Your Digital Wallet - Download Metamask</h3>

[Download Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (Digital Wallet) - Note that there are two versions of Metamask, the mobile application and Google Chrome extension if you're using a laptop.
Once you're set up you should see the following:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*FJoJWj-yc1OcCJY8.jpg)

**NOTE: When you sign up for Metamask it is important that you do not share or lose your SEED PHRASE and PASSWORD! Sharing your Metamask seed phrase or password to anyone will allow access to your assets and NFTs. Keep them both in a secure place ❗️**

Each Metamask wallet comes with it's own unique address. You'll use **this** address when sending ETH from Coinbase to your Metamask wallet. More on addresses and viewing your account details [here](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488791-How-to-view-your-account-details-public-address).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*Dsx8exa6-lhSW7Zs.png)

<h3>View Your Address and Transactions on Etherscan</h3>

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a tool to help you view data regarding any pending or confirmed Ethereum blockchain transactions you make or receive. Since Ethereum is a public, open blockchain, whenever anyone interacts with it the action is recorded into the transaction history and it is open for anyone to see. Etherscan is a very useful resource because it helps you navigate through this data to make better sense of where your ETH is going.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*waFl5wum3iRi3OhSBJu0ZQ.png)

In order to look up your wallet, copy and paste your public wallet address into the search bar at the top of their home page. Once you submit this, you will be taken to a page that shows key metrics for your wallet, such as ETH balance and corresponding USD value, and your full history of transactions.

<h2>Marketplace 🏬</h2>

Now that you're set up with some ETH in your MetaMask wallet 👇

<h3>Get an Opensea Account</h3>

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Qm7KJDh9TLQNuypiKoOI9g.png)

Get an account by visiting [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) and connecting your Metamask wallet to the site. Your NFTs will go here after they are minted.

<h3>Mint an NFT</h3>

You can mint your own NFT on Opensea or you can mint an NFT from a new art collection or release. 

When visiting an NFT collection site, you will be asked to connect your wallet before minting. This process is important, so be sure to check the site for authenticity before doing so. 

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*d7wWawpvNsTv11Y0kuOIMQ.png)

Once connected, you will see a button to "Mint" your NFT. Choose the amount that you would like to mint, keeping in mind the mint price for one. 

<h3>ETH Gas Fees!!! 🚗</h3>

Gas is essentially a fee that is required to execute a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain platform. Every purchase you make will incur a gas fee. Unfortunately there is no getting around gas fees at this time. 
This gas fee is priced in small fractions of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) that are referred to as Gwei.

More on [Gas Fees](https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/featured/what-the-heck-is-ethereums-gas-fee-and-why-is-it-necessary)

You can also track gas on Etherscan before you decide to make a purchase or sell. The lower the gas, lower the fee. Always try to avoid high gas.

<h3>Viewing Your Minted NFT on Opensea</h3>

It may take a couple of seconds for your mint to reveal on Opensea. In newer collection releases there may be a wait time before the reveal takes place. Some collections wait until sell out or 24 hours for reveal. 

Refreshing the metadata on your newly minted NFT will also reveal your surprise after a minute or two.

<h3>Understand Floor Price and Volume on OpenSea</h3>

**Floor**: The lowest price for an NFT in the collection. Higher the floor price, more profit you'll likely make in a sale.

**Volume**: Amount of ETH traded through sales.

<h3>Buy on Opensea</h3>

On Opensea, you can buy or make an offer on any item, as long as you have enough ETH in your wallet. Remember that even here you will incur a gas fee so wait until gas is low.

<h3>Sell on Opensea</h3>

If you are selling, the process is similar to buying. Navigate to your item and click on the sell button.

<h3> First Time Seller Charge</h3>

While selling on Opensea is free, your first listing will incur a one time charge.

More information on first listing fees [here](https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/1500003246262-What-fees-do-I-pay-for-my-first-listing-). Expect a payment of around $100 for your first listing.

<h2>Quick Flip or Hodl?</h2>

Now that you've minted your NFT will you hold it or sell it? 

Quick Flippers are those who are in it for a quick profit. Buy an NFT, sell it at a higher price. Can also be known as **Paper Hands** in the NFT Community.

Hodl means that you've decided to hold - Those who choose to hold on to their NFT's or investments do so for either incentives in the project itself or possible larger profit. Can also be known as **Diamond Hands** in the NFT Community.

<h3>Where to Find NFT Projects & Communities</h3>

[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/search?q=nft%20community&src=typeahead_click) - You'll find a host of upcoming NFT projects on Twitter where much of the NFT community lives. Follow important hashtags such as #NFT #NFTCommunity #NFTCollector as well as Twitter pages that focus on NFTs or release dates. 

**Discord** - Where a lot of the fun goes down! Join some servers, get on the whitelist so that you can ensure a spot for an early mint. This is especially important for popular collection releases.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*H3I54S1N1ntC09iyCOH46Q.png)

[**Rarity Tools**](https://rarity.tools/) - Shows rarity of a collections NFTs. Also a great place to search for upcoming NFT drops.

<h2>THIS IS SECTION IS VERY IMPORTANT 😡 </h2>

<h3>About Rug Pulls 😢</h3>

An NFT rug pull is essentially a scam where a developer or dev team will release promising project or digital assets on a marketplace. As the liquidity dies down, the person takes all of the liquidity for themselves and dips. This tends to result in the NFTs having significantly reduced volume and the promises involving the project never suffice.

<h3>About Bots, Scammers and Attacks on Discord Servers 😵</h3>

Can't escape them, they are everywhere. When joining groups and Discord servers do not engage with anyone sending you a direct message. The goal of scammers and bots is to get you to click on a fake link that will ask to connect your Metamask wallet for your password or other type of personal information like seed phrase to compromise your wallet. 

There have been numerous bot attacks on Discord servers meant to either take down the project, or steer people to fake pages. Keep your guard up and be vigilant. Links that are too good to be true, are most likely too good to be true.

<h2>Volatility in Markets</h2>

You're not going to like this part, but expect volatility. The price of Bitcoin can rise and fall and the same holds true with Ethereum. If you're coming into the NFT space expecting a quick profit overnight then this is not the space for you. You will have some wins and you will lose especially on projects that don't have a solid roadmap. 
  
There's also nothing stoppng you from starting your own NFT collection if you have the talent.
